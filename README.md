The goal of this project is to produce a custom sign-up form with interesting interactive features using CSS (visual cues about validity of input fields, interactive button...).

## Skills to practice

- Working with HTML form element and its specific attributes
- Using CSS variables (custom properties)
- Using CSS pseudo-elements (before, after) and pseudo-classes (valid, invalid)
- Working with Developer Tools

## Features

Simple sign up form with :
- Simple visible cues (ðŸ—¸ / x) for the user to know if the field is correctly completed
- Built-in validation pattern for email or phone number
- Passwords-match checking
- Clean UI

## Improvements

- Clean code by breaking functions into even smaller and pure functions if possible and regroup related variables / functions into classes or objects
- Add form validation with JavaScript (regex patterns for email/password/phone number)
